    <p>Carlsen learned how to play chess when he was five years old. However, he didn’t show much interest at first. He instead amazed other people by completing activities that demonstrated his general intellectual aptitude at an early age.<br><br>At two years of age, Carlsen could solve 50-piece jigsaw puzzles. He also played with Lego sets intended for children 10 to 14 years old. When Henrik Carlsen, his father, introduced him to chess, the five-year-old was busy memorizing the areas, population numbers, flags and capitals of every country in the world. Later Carlsen completed a similar task—memorizing areas, population numbers, coat-of-arms and administrative centers—for nearly all Norwegian municipalities (there are 422 municipalities today).<br><br>Carlsen's impressive memory helped as he became more interested in chess. Initially, he simply wanted to beat his oldest sister. But soon he was replaying games that his father had showed him, practicing combinations while playing against himself and reading chess books. His first book was Find the Plan from GM Bent Larsen, the six-time Danish champion and the strongest-ever Scandinavian player—before Carlsen.<br><br>Early in his chess career, Carlsen was coached by Norway’s top player, the seven-time national champion GM Simen Agdestein, who with former Norwegian junior champion Torbjorn Ringdal Hansen helped Carlsen hone his talent quickly. In one year (2000), his rating increased more than 1,000 points, from 904 to 1907.<br><br>It didn’t take long for Carlsen to rack up impressive performances and tournament wins. In July 2000, the nine-year-old won the youngest age group at the Norwegian championship—for players under the age of 11—with a score of 10/11. Shortly thereafter, he took part in a couple of events and scored a performance rating of about 1900 in one.<br><br>Then his breakthrough performance came, according to Carlsen and his family. At the Norwegian championship for junior teams in September 2000, he scored 3.5 out of 5 against the country’s top players. Still just nine years old, Carlsen achieved a rating performance of about 2000 in the event.</p>
